# Statistical-Analysis-of-World's-Energy-Consumption
## Overview

This project analyzes the dataset of energy consumption of the world from 1984 to 2022. It consists of renuable energy as well as non renuable energy adn the various columns consists of Other renewables (TWh ), Biofuels (TWh ),	Solar (TWh ),	Wind (TWh ),	Hydropower (TWh ),	Nuclear (TWh ),	Traditional biomass (TWh ),	Gas (TWh ),	Oil (TWh ),	Coal (TWh ),	Total Non-renewables(gasoil & coal).
